📌 **Project Title:** *Digital Community Medicine & Health Service Management System*





This is a **real-life scenario–based project**, developed as part of our **Object-Oriented Programming** coursework, with proper functional requirement identification and object-oriented design principles.
The system currently supports **four user roles**:
• Patient
• Doctor
• Pharmacist
• Admin
Please note that this is an **ongoing project**, which is why the design is intentionally kept simple at this stage. There is still scope for further improvements and feature enhancements, which we look forward to working on.
Grateful to my team members for their collaboration and effort throughout this project. Feedback and suggestions are always welcome!
